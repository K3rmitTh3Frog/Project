# Saturday Update

## Description

In this latest update, we've introduced several significant improvements. The email functionality is now fully operational in the prototype version of the application. Our code has been enhanced to utilize various Google Cloud APIs, and we've seamlessly integrated additional functions into the React-based test screen.

## Google APIs

This code version brings support for various Google APIs, including the Email API and Google Maps API through OAuth 2.0.

## Email Integration

Users can now effortlessly link their Gmail accounts with the application, granting them direct access to their inbox within the application. The application autonomously identifies senders on the priority email list and elevates the priority of their messages. Additionally, the system is configured to retrieve the user's most recent 10 emails from the Gmail inbox and store them in the application's database.

## APIs Seamlessly Integrated with Test Frontend

We've harmoniously integrated the project's APIs with a test frontend, resulting in a more intuitive and interactive user interface. This enhancement significantly contributes to an overall improved user experience.
