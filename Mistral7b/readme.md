Here is the JavaScript code to add two numbers and return their sum:\n
```js
function addNumbers(num1, num2) {\n  let sum = num1 + num2;\n  return sum;}
```
You can call this function by passing in two arguments `num1` and `num2`, which will be the two numbers to add. The function calculates their sum using the `+` operator and returns it. You can then use the returned sum in your program as needed.
